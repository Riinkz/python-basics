2. Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 through 5, each followed by that many asterisks, like
   `3 ***`.
3. Use a second loop with `range(10, 0, -2)` to print even numbers downward: `10  8  6  4  2`.
4. Prompt the user to enter a secret word. Give them up to **3 tries**.

   - If they guess correctly, print `"Access granted"` and end the loop with `break`.
   - If they fail all three attempts, print `"Access denied"` after the loop using the `else` clause.

5. Make a list named `hobbies` with at least three items. Loop through it and print
   `"I enjoy <hobby>"` for each one.
