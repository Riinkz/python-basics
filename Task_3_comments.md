If you've seen my solution for task 2, you might have noticed me using the '#' symbol. Anything that's still in the same line after a '#' gets ignored when executing the code. You can also use the tripple quote, in order to use multi-line comments.

Examples:

```python
is_admin_user   = True       # True means this user is an admin

# or

"""
This comment explains a function,
which doesn't exist yet.
"""
```

In Python, comments are essential for improving your code's readability, maintainability, and general quality. They are an indispensable resource for recording your ideas, deciphering intricate reasoning, and giving context to other developers or your future self.
