### **Task 5 - Numbers**

Python handles basic arithmetic much like a calculator.
Below is a quick tour of the most common operators.

```python
print(2 + 1)   # addition            -> 3
print(2 - 1)   # subtraction         -> 1
print(2 * 1)   # multiplication      -> 2
print(2 / 1)   # true division       -> 2.0  (always returns a float)
print(5 // 2)  # floor division      -> 2
print(5 % 2)   # modulus (remainder) -> 1
print(2 ** 3)  # exponentiation      -> 8
```

#### Assignment shortcuts

```python
x = 10
x = x + 2   # classic way (x is now 12)
x += 2      # shorthand (x is now 14)
```

Any operator can be paired with `=` in this fashion: `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and so on.

#### Your exercise

1. Create a file called `Task_8.py`.
2. Inside it, set `a = 12` and `b = 5`.
3. Print the results of `a + b`, `a - b`, `a * b`, `a / b`, `a // b`, `a % b` and `a ** b`.
4. Create a variable `score = 0`, then add `10` to it using `+=`. Print the final score.

Run the script and confirm each result matches your expectations.
