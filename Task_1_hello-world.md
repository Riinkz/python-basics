### **Task 1 - Hello World**

Before doing anything else in a new programming language, you traditionally
make it say **“Hello world”**.
In Python that’s a one-liner:

```python
print("Hello world")
```

The `print()` function sends whatever you give it straight to the console.

#### **Repeating output**

You can ask Python to repeat a string by multiplying it:

```python
print("example " * 5)
```

That prints one line containing the word example five times.

#### **Your exercise**

1. Create a new file called `Task_1.py` in your editor.
2. Write the lines shown below.
3. Run the file from your terminal or IDE and watch the output.

```python
print("Hello world")
print("example " * 5)
```

> **Hint:** Text must always be wrapped in quotes (`' '` or `" "`).
> Forgetting them makes Python think it’s a variable name and you’ll get an
> error.
