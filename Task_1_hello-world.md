The first thing to do, when learning any programming language, is to print the text "Hello world".
In python, a print function call is as basic, as it gets:

```python
print("example")
```

This will output the text "example" to the console.

You can also repeat function calls like this:

```python
print("example " * 5)
```

Now try writing a "Hello World" python script and executing the file.

Hint: Always put strings (text) in quotes.
