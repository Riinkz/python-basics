### **Task 2 - Variables**

Variables are “named boxes” that hold data.
In Python you create one with a simple assignment:

```python
cable_count = 5
```

Now `cable_count` stores the integer `5`.

#### **Primitive value types**

Python variables can contain any of the basic (primitive) data types:

```python
rating     = 4.20      # float (decimal number)
name       = "John"    # string (text)
is_admin   = True      # boolean (True/False)
```

You can even write multi-line strings by using triple quotes:

```python
review = """
Python basics are so easy!
"""
```

> **Hint:** Choose clear, descriptive variable names,
> they make code easier for everyone (including *future you*) to read.

#### **Your exercise**

1. Create a new file called `Task_2.py`.
2. Inside it, declare four variables—an integer, a float, a string, and a boolean.
3. Print each variable on its own line.
4. Change at least two variables (e.g., add 3 to the integer, adjust the float), then print them again.
5. Add a triple-quoted string to describe what you learned and print it.

When you run the file you should see the original values, the updated values, and your multi-line note.
