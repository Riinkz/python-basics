Variables in python can simply be declared like this:

```python
cable_count = 5
```

Now x has the value 5.
Variables by default can store primitive values. Meaning and integer, float(decimal), string, boolean.

```python
rating = 4.20
name = "John"
is_admin = True
```

Strings can also span multiple lines, when using tripple quotes:

```python
Review = """
Python basics are so easy! 
"""
```

Hint: ==Make sure to always use descriptive variable names. That's just basic code of conduct for coding/scripting.==

You can then use these variables in functions or modify them. Give it a try!
