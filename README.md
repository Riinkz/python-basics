# Python Basics

_A playground for absolute beginners_

### What’s inside?

Each numbered task introduces one fundamental concept. The tasks are in the markdown (`.md`) files. My solutions are inside the python (`.py`) files - but there's countless ways achieve the same goal!

1.  Hello World & the `print` function
2.  Variables & primitive types
3.  Comments & good code hygiene
4.  Numbers and arithmetic
5.  Number utilities (`abs`, `round`, etc.)
6.  f-strings for readable output
7.  String methods (upper, find, slice…)
8.  Built-in number functions
9.  User input & type conversion
10. Comparison operators (`<`, `==`, …)
11. Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
12. Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
13. `for` loops & iteration patterns
14. `while` loops & break/continue
15. Functions, arguments & return values

Additionally, there are multiple exercises, which might teach you a little trick or two.

### Quick start

> **Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 + (anything later works too)
> **Tip:** Work through the tasks in order—each builds gently on the last.
